I worked with simulated or exported CSV data from Facebook Ads Manager. MY goal is to analyze campaign performance metrics and build an interactive dashboard that helps businesses answer questions like:

How well did the ad campaign perform?
Which posts or ads had the highest engagement?
What was the Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Return on Investment (ROI)?
What can we improve for the next campaign?
